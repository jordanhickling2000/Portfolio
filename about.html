                <h2>What I Am Doing Currently</h2>
                <p>From mid-July to present (Will be updated when this has changed) I have been on the scion scheme with Netmatters learning how to make and recreate websites.</p>
                <p>To find out more about what the scion scheme is and offers either click on the "SCS software" tab in the navigation or click here: <a href="scs.html">SCS Software</a></p> 
                <p>So far with this course I have been able to learn HTML and CSS and how to use Github and Sass to make a responsive website. From the portfolio page you can see my projects that have been worked on through the course.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="hobbies">
                <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
                <p>I have a big amount of hobbies which I will only list a few that I believe are relevant to all day uses to me.</p>
                <p>One of the hobbies I have, is what you would expect from this page and all the information. This is coding. I enjoy learning different coding languages and enjoy making things with the code.</p>
                <p>If you would like to check out the other projects I have made after reading this page you can either click "Portfolio" off the navigation or click here: <a href="index.php#card-link">My Portfolio</a></p>
                <p>Since I was young I have played video games and enjoyed them but whilst growing up I started to wonder about the code behind it. I do enjoy learning the concept behind what code makes a game. I also enjoyed making a python text adventure game in University.</p>
                <p>The last hobby that I will talk about is my passion for chess. I like watching and playing chess due to the extreme thinking skills you require through the game which can help with problem solving and overall is an enjoyable game to play.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="education">
                <h2>My Education</h2>
                <p>I have been through a lot of different education. The main one will start from High school. I attented Bungay High School in which I took my GCSES and left with 5 C's. I then went on into Bungay Sixth Form studying Business Studies for a year which I managed to pass.</p>
                <p>After finishing the year at Bungay Sixth Form I decided that I wanted to follow a career in IT because it is what I enjoyed. I went into Norwich City College where I did 2 years of IT studies this was Website Development to Social Media to Programming and many more! At this point I had an idea of what I wanted in my career path which will be explained later on in this page.</p>
                <p>After the two years at Norwich City College I decided to go into further education, going into Website and mobile app development however, this did not last long because of covid in 2020 and for personal reasons I decided to leave after just a year of University.</p>
                <p>Lastly, as mentioned in the "What I Am Doing Currently" section I am learning website developement within the Netmatters scion scheme to sharpen and learn new skills in website developement.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="career-path">
                <h2>My Career Path</h2>
                <p>For the last section of this page I will be explaining what my career path is and what I wish to be doing within time limits.</p>
                <p>For my career path I want to be going into IT that is the most simplistic goal in mind. For a more advanced answer I would like to be going into any kind of coding work game design, web design, mobile app design and many more. Whilst it will mean I have to learn on the go or learn before hand I would ideally like this line of work because it is challanging and enjoyable to persue.</p>
                <p>My all time goal is throughout my life to go into AI development this wont be an early goal this is my long term goal. In the next 5-15 years I would like to gain knowledge on how AI work and go into development within them. 15 years is a long time, but during that time I am hoping to know much more coding languages so I can achieve that goal.</p>
                <p>15 years is definitely a long, long time away. Within the next 5 years I want to be doing website development or programming in general this is to sharpen my coding skills for the long-term goal.</p>
                <p>And that's it my simple career path I have planned. Whilst it may not all go that way I am doing what I can to try my best to achieve it. For example taking this scion course is a step in the right direction to learn HTML code. This is just my career path and I have many other plans in terms of location and much more, but I will leave it with this simple career path explanation.</p>
